#STAT 159 - fall-2016 Homework 3

This repository holds the third assignment for the fall 2016 Statistics 159 at UC Berkeley.

This assignment is about applying the computational toolkit (plus R) to reproduce regression analysis. More specifically, the idea is to reproduce the analysis from Section 3.2 (page 71 to 82), of Chapter 3:*Linear Regression*, from the book "An introduction to Statistical Learning" (by James et at) at http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/.

The puorpose of this assignment is to extend the scope of the previous HW2. In addition to keep applying regression analysis in R -- using `lm()`-- I will also write some functions as well as their unit tests.
